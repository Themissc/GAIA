          <p>Forests are essential to our planet's health. They provide habitat for countless species, absorb carbon dioxide, and release oxygen. Preserving our forests is crucial for maintaining ecological balance and mitigating climate change.</p>

          <p>Forests cover about 31% of the Earth's land area. They are a source of biodiversity, offering shelter and sustenance to a variety of plants and animals. Additionally, forests play a significant role in regulating the climate by absorbing and storing carbon.</p>
