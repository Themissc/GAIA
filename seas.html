        <h1 class="brown">Protecting Our Oceans</h1>
            <p>Oceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface and are essential for life on our planet. They regulate climate, provide food, and are home to countless species. It's our responsibility to protect and preserve our oceans.</p>
                        <h2 class="brown">The Importance of Oceans</h2>
            <p>Oceans are responsible for producing over 70% of the Earth's oxygen and absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide. They are vital for regulating global temperature and weather patterns.</p>
            <h2 class="brown">Our Conservation Efforts</h2>
            <p>GAIA is deeply committed to ocean conservation. We work on marine protection, sustainable fishing practices, and reducing plastic pollution in the oceans. Our marine reserves protect critical habitats and support sustainable fishing communities.</p>
            
            <p>We also advocate for reducing single-use plastics and increasing recycling to prevent plastic waste from entering our oceans.</p>
            <h2 class="brown">Challenges We Face</h2>
            <p>Oceans are threatened by overfishing, pollution, and the consequences of climate change. Rising sea levels, coral bleaching, and ocean acidification are significant concerns that require global cooperation to address.</p>
            <h2 class="brown">Get Involved</h2>
            <p>You can make a difference by supporting organizations like GAIA, reducing your plastic usage, and promoting sustainable fishing practices. Join our efforts to protect marine life and ensure the health of our oceans for future generations.</p>
